# Memapp[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/petercunning/memapp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/petercunning/memapp)
## Membership application.
I inherited this application and upgraded from a rails 1.x application and upgraded to run on rails 3.1.
A lot more work to do to, but getting there.
Moved from SVN to git, creating tests and add travis CI.
